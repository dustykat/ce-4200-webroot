Dear,

Wenjie, Fei; Ameri Gurley; David Spears; Wei Zhang.

Attached is the tentative schedule for CE 4200 this fall.  As in the past a 50-minute SME led review of Fluid Mechanics is requested.

The class is at 8:00-8:50PM (at night!) in CE205.  I have targeted you as either a recent or current instructor, only one of you needs to provide a review. Please decide who does the session let me know (and the others).  If you can think of other people to add to the list also let me know so we can share the fun in the future.

I have linked what I have on the course web page for the topic. http://54.243.252.9/ce-4200-webroot/ce-4200-notes/_build/html/lessons/fereview/FluidMechanics/FER-Fluids.html

If you have materials you would like added to the webpage, you can send them as PDF (i will simply store and link), docx (I will store as supplied then convert to PDF and link), or if you want to build out the page docx is easiest for me to convert into html be sure to imbed graphics).  

An example "training page" is shown at http://54.243.252.9/ce-4200-webroot/ce-4200-notes/_build/html/lessons/fereview/Economics/EngineeringEconomics-WorkItOut.html
