\section*{Documentation of Professional Development}
Documentation is simple, and important.  I know of several people who have been audited, and it appears that the board intends to audit a sample of all licensed engineers every year.    The Act specifies that the engineer should maintain a log of professional development activities as well as proof of those activities in the form of completion certificates and so forth.  The TBPE has an on-line log tool you can use, a paper based log, and I suppose even a calendar entry would be sufficient.  The minimum information the act expects you to be able to provide are type of activity, sponsoring organization, location, duration, instructors name, and PDH credits claimed.  

If you are audited, and the board decides the activities are insufficient the Act specifies that the board may require the license holder to obtain the requisite hours as needed in activities that meet the board's approval.
