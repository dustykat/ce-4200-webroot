Below is a tentative schedule for CE 4200 this fall.  
- The class is at 8:00-8:50PM (at night!) in CE205.  
- There is some flexibilty in moving things around. 
- The goofy formatting is so the CSS compiler makes a pretty table when posted to the web server.  
- The rows that show quiz programmed refer to quizzes already programmed at http://3.85.103.207/  
- You should examine the quiz for your topic (username == ttustudent  passwd == Forid10t$) 
should grant you access the the course, then navigate to the quizzes.  
- If you just want to see the quiz simply "take the quiz" and just randomly choose an answer.  
- If the row needs a quiz; feel free to send me the quiz (pdf, docx) (WITH ANSWERS) and I can program it, 
  try to go easy on graphics they are a pain in the neck to load.  
- The students will be taking quizzes on Canvas (not Moodle, but they will function the same).
- If you have fully worked solutions(not just answers), they will get stored differently - so put them into a different file.

I am taking medical leave week of 23 Sep, so those two days are available for switching into if you wish.
