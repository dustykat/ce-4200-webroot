    "The final exam is comprised of questions derived from the \"Framing the Profession\" section, the \"Beyond the Technical\" section, and an FE Exam simulation (Mock FE - reduced length and scope).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The FE exam simulation is based on circa 2017 and earlier materials.  You are allowed the [NCEES supplied reference](https://help.ncees.org/article/87-ncees-exam-reference-handbooks) and a calculator (the embedded calculator in Canvas is turned on, but be careful to clear work between problems).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Using FE specifications as a guideline, the exam will take a bit over 3 hours to complete (2 minutes/question for FE questions, 1 minutes/question for profesional practices contents).  As such the exam is provided online via Canvas, with several days to work through the exam.  A preview of the exam is linked below.\n",
