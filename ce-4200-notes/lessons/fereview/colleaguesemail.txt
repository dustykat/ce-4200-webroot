Subject: CE 4200 FE Review Session – Schedule and Materials

Dear [Name],

Attached is the proposed schedule for the CE 4200 FE Review sessions. The review sessions are scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays, 20:00–20:50 (8–8:50 PM) in CE 205. Your assigned topic is [Topic].

The course webpage (as of this message) is: [URL to 4200 Topic Landing Page]. I have pre-populated the page with available materials; please review both the webpage and the attached schedule, and reply to confirm:

That you are available on your scheduled date, and

Whether you have materials you would like distributed ahead of time. I can easily post Word documents or PDF files to the course site. If you prefer that I typeset your lesson, I am glad to help—please keep graphics to a minimum, as they are more difficult to integrate.

For an example of a more fully developed page, you may refer to: [URL to Economics].

At the bottom of the topic webpage you will also find a preview of the quiz that will be administered. If you would like to add additional quiz items, please send them to me and I will program them into the system.

Thank you in advance for your preparation and contribution to these sessions.

Best regards,
[Sensei]

P.S. If you are not planning to lead a session, please identify the individual in your group who will be responsible for presenting.
