    "\n",
    "In surveying, a backsight (BS) is a reading taken to a point of known elevation, typically a benchmark, to help establish or verify the height of the surveying instrument (like a level or theodolite) before measuring points of unknown elevation. It is a \"backward\" sight along the line of progress and is essential for calculating the height of instrument (HI) and determining the elevation of subsequent points in the survey.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of a Backsight**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Establish Instrument Height: When a surveying instrument is set up in a new location, a backsight on a point with a known elevation (like a benchmark) is used to calculate the instrument's height. \n",
    "- Maintain Level Circuits: In leveling surveys, backsights are taken on a known point to keep a continuous record of elevation changes as the instrument is moved. \n",
    "- Verify Elevations: Backsights are also used to check the accuracy of the survey by ensuring the calculated elevation of the instrument matches the expected elevation of the point. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up the instrument: The surveying instrument is positioned on a stable surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Take the backsight: A leveling rod is held vertically at a point with a known reduced level (RL), and the surveyor takes a reading with the instrument. \n",
    "- Calculate the height of instrument (HI): The backsight reading is added to the known RL of the benchmark to find the HI. For example, if a benchmark is at 98 meters and the backsight reading is 3 meters, the HI is 101 meters. \n",
    "- Take foresights: From this established HI, foresights (FS) are then taken on points where the elevation needs to be determined.\n",
