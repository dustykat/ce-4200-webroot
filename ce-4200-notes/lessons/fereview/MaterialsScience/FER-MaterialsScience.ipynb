    ":::{tip}\n",
    "Materials Science is closely related to Mechanics of Materials, but it is not the same.  \n",
    "While *mechanics* focuses on how materials respond to forces (stress, strain, deformation, and failure), *materials science* focuses on why materials behave that way—examining their chemical composition, microstructure, and processing history.\n",
    "\n",
    "It explores how atomic bonding, crystalline structure, and defects influence mechanical and chemical properties, and how these can be modified through heat treatment, alloying, compositing, or curing processes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Typical topics include:\n",
    "- Testing and characterization of materials (tensile, hardness, fatigue, and microstructure analysis)  \n",
    "- Phase diagrams and the effects of heat treatment on metals  \n",
    "- Corrosion, fatigue, and environmental degradation mechanisms  \n",
    "- The relationship between microstructure and macroscopic performance  \n",
    "\n",
    "The principal materials of engineering interest are concrete (both components and finished mixes), steel and other metals/alloys, wood, resins, and fibers—each chosen based on its performance, cost, and sustainability within the design context.\n",
