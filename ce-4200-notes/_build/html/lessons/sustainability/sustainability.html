<h1>Evaluation of Sustainability Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluation-of-sustainability-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>This topic is an ABET required topic transferred from CE 4330 to this course</strong></p>
<p>As you move closer to becoming licensed professionals, you’ll increasingly be asked to consider the long-term impacts of your designs, not just in terms of performance or cost, but also how they affect the environment, society, and future generations.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-sustainability">
<h2>What is Sustainability?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-sustainability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At its core, sustainability is about ensuring that the way we meet our needs today doesn’t compromise the ability of future generations to meet theirs. This principle was popularized by the Brundtland Commission in the 1987 report Our Common Future, which set the stage for modern discussions on sustainability.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The publication of Our Common Future and the work of the World Commission on Environment and Development laid the groundwork for the convening of the 1992 Earth Summit and the adoption of Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration and to the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development.</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Meeting Present Needs:</strong> This refers to addressing the economic, social, and environmental needs of society today. Engineers, for example, must ensure that the infrastructure, technologies, and processes we design can provide for today’s population in terms of energy, water, transportation, food production, and other critical resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Without Compromising Future Generations:</strong> The second part of the definition emphasizes intergenerational equity. This means that future generations should have access to the same, or better, resources and environmental conditions than we have today. If we deplete non-renewable resources, damage ecosystems, or contribute to pollution and climate change, future generations will face much greater challenges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why it matters in engineering:</strong> Environmental responsibility, social equity, long-term economic viability.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition-a-new-imperialism admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">A New Imperialism</p>
<p>The Brundtland Commission report is perceived by the Third World as green imperialism.  Green imperialism (also called eco-imperialism, eco-colonialism, or environmental imperialism) is a derogatory epithet alluding to what is perceived as a Western strategy to influence the internal affairs of mostly developing nations in the name of environmentalism.  Circa 2024 one can argue the West is kind of choking on its “own” vision of a Green Future.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Sustainability isn’t just about “going green” or minimizing waste—it’s about making sure our solutions are resilient, efficient, and equitable over the long term. As engineers, you’re not only solving today’s problems, but you’re also designing for the future.</p>
</div>
<p>So how do we balance today’s needs with future considerations? Here’s what it looks like when applied to engineering and design:</p>
<div class="section" id="resource-efficiency">
<h3>Resource Efficiency:<a class="headerlink" href="#resource-efficiency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We need to use resources efficiently—whether it’s energy, raw materials, or water—so we aren’t depleting them faster than they can be replenished.
In practice, this might involve designing buildings that use less energy, creating systems that reuse or recycle materials, and optimizing industrial processes to minimize waste.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="renewable-resources">
<h3>Renewable Resources:<a class="headerlink" href="#renewable-resources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Shifting from finite resources (like fossil fuels) to renewable resources (like solar or wind energy) is key. This ensures that we don’t run out of essential resources over time and helps mitigate environmental damage like pollution or habitat destruction.</p>

<h2>The Triple Bottom Line<a class="headerlink" href="#the-triple-bottom-line" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When evaluating sustainability in your designs, there’s a model called the Triple Bottom Line that we use: People, Planet, and Profit.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/3BL.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>People: Social impacts—How does your design impact communities and public health? One component of the triple bottom line highlights a business’s societal impact, or its commitment to people. <br><br>It’s important to make the distinction between a firm’s shareholders and stakeholders. Traditionally, businesses have favored shareholder value as an indicator of success, meaning they strive to generate value for those who own shares of the company. As firms have increasingly embraced sustainability, they’ve shifted their focus toward creating value for all stakeholders impacted by business decisions, including customers, employees, and community members.<br><br>Some simple ways companies can make an impact on people—and serve future generations—include ensuring fair hiring practices and encouraging volunteerism in the workplace. They can also look externally to effect change on a larger scale. For instance, many organizations have formed successful strategic partnerships with nonprofit organizations that share a common purpose-driven goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Planet: Environmental impacts—What is the environmental footprint of your project? Are you considering renewable resources or minimizing waste? Another component of the triple bottom line is concerned with making a positive impact on the planet.<br><br>Since the birth of the Industrial Revolution, large corporations have contributed a staggering amount of pollution to the environment, which has been a key driver of climate change and environmental concerns. A report by the International Energy Agency found that the global energy industry released 135 million tonnes of methane into the atmosphere in 2022.<br><br>While businesses have historically been the greatest contributors to climate change, they also hold the keys to driving positive change. Many business leaders are now recognizing their social responsibility to do so. This effort isn’t solely on the shoulders of the world’s largest corporations—virtually all businesses have opportunities to make changes that reduce their carbon footprint. Adjustments like using ethically sourced materials, cutting down on energy consumption, and streamlining shipping practices are steps in the right direction toward long-term sustainability.</p></li>
<li><p>Profit: Economic impacts—How will your design contribute to long-term economic benefits?  In a capitalist economy, a firm’s success most heavily depends on its financial performance, or the profit it generates for shareholders. Strategic planning initiatives and key business decisions are generally carefully designed to maximize profits while reducing costs and mitigating risk.<br><br>In the past, many firms’ goals have solely focused on economic impact and growth. Now, purpose-driven leaders are discovering they have the power to use their businesses to effect positive change in the world without hampering financial performance. In many cases, adopting sustainability initiatives has proven to drive business success.</p></li>

<h2>Sustainability in Engineering Design – Key Evaluation Metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#sustainability-in-engineering-design-key-evaluation-metrics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some key evaluation metrics for sustainability in design:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Climate risk: Climate risk was reported as a newly emerging environmental metric as companies account for the changing environment and the physical risks of climate change. The GreenBiz report data shows 86% companies now publish a sustainability report and a large majority of these companies are acknowledging their exposure to climate-related risks. Of these, 82% reported regulatory transition risks and 79% described physical risks from climate change in their reports that could negatively impact productivity and success.<br><br>As the world’s response to climate change remains uncertain, forward-looking scenario-based assessments of transitional and physical climate risk, such as those recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), can help companies develop risk mitigation strategies across corporate asset locations, supply chains, and product life cycles.</p></li>
<li><p>Carbon emissions: The Paris Agreement is a landmark international accord that was adopted by nearly every nation in 2015 to address climate change and its negative impacts. The agreement aims to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit the global temperature increase to 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050.<br><br>The emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollution that results from the burning of fossil fuels used to generate electric power, provide power for transportation (cars, trucks, and air travel), and heat homes and buildings is the major factor contributing to climate change. Efforts to improve energy efficiency, migrate to renewable energy, and shift from coal to methane provide solutions to reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>Companies are beginning to take efforts to reduce emissions, such as migrating from coal to natural gas, which is 85% more efficient in producing electric power. As companies make these migrations and reduce emissions, metrics and reporting will be the only reliable factor that tells the story of change and ensures companies can reach their target goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Energy improvements: Energy use is the largest factor impacting environmental sustainability and is a direct contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and other compounds that are detrimental to the environment. Therefore, every company’s energy improvement matters and so do the metrics used to track this energy consumption. Companies are beginning to implement alternate, renewable sources of energy into their operations such as solar energy and wind power.<br><br>Companies are also utilizing different methods such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.g2.com/categories/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-reporting">ESG platforms</a> and IoT (Internet of Things) sensors to accurately measure and track energy consumption, a dynamic process that provides an analytical framework to monitor, measure, and catalog data.</p></li>
<li><p>Water reduction: Water is a critical and primary metric because of its prevalent, daily usage within most companies and facilities. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that the 46,000 large commercial buildings (200,000+ square feet) in the U.S. used about 359 billion gallons of water (980 million gallons per day) in 2012. <br><br>Beyond water reduction, the loss of water from leaking pipes or water distribution lines must be considered, along with water pollution, which was added as a new metric in the GreenBiz report. Water pollution is measured by the “total natural capital cost of the environmental impacts from heavy-metal and pesticide pollution or from excess fertilizer use causing algal blooms.”<br><br>Unfortunately, the report also stated company water use has averaged a 9% yearly increase since 2015, both for U.S. companies and globally, and water pollution costs have nearly doubled since 2014. Utilizing goal-oriented metrics to monitor water quality, consumption, and leakage will play a crucial role in conserving water as well as protecting the health and safety of people and the environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Waste diversion: Waste management is a broad category, including food waste, agricultural and animal waste, medical waste, radioactive waste, hazardous waste, industrial non-hazardous waste, construction and demolition debris, extraction and mining waste, oil and gas production waste, fossil fuel combustion waste, and more.<br><br>To better understand waste, companies are beginning to use circular frameworks as a tool to assess and track the full scope of material flows in their operations (see link to LCA below). In 2020, the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute offered a set of metrics tailored specifically for the circular economy, which included considerations of sourcing such as recycled or renewable content, design of intentional end-of-life strategy such as disassembly, recoverable content such as recyclability or biodegradability, and investment in infrastructure to enable a circular economy.<br><br>Countries, cities, and companies that can commit to circularity goals and waste measurement frameworks will enable data-driven decision-making, progress-tracking, and accountability that reduces waste, creates jobs, and adds economic value while supporting the environment.</p></li>

<div class="admonition-what-does-a-green-rating-do-for-the-engineering-client admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">What does a green rating do for the engineering client?</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Enhances the design process: Green rating systems offer guidelines and metrics that improve collaboration and provide a framework that defines “sustainability” and links project issues and solutions within the context of sustainability.</p></li>
<li><p>Provides economic benefits: A green rating system often results in a more efficient, durable and resilient project. Utilizing a sustainability framework helps to reduce waste and energy costs and provides opportunities for tax incentives and long-term operational cost savings.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduces risk: Green rating systems focus attention on project goals, means and methods. Green projects are better prepared to mitigate the severe impacts of natural disasters. These projects are also better designed to prevent losses from fire and plumbing damage and withstand unpredictable energy prices.</p></li>
<li><p>Adds a competitive advantage: Green rating systems challenge teams to look at the project from new angles that present possibilities for reducing costs, extending project life, attracting investors, appealing to stakeholders and the public, improving community well-being, and providing many other benefits that increase the owner’s competitive edge and the project’s ROI.</p></li>
<li><p>Increases accountability: Green rating systems link sustainability policy to planning and design so that the overall project vision is used throughout the process. These rating systems also promote stakeholder participation and provide milestones that help to monitor progress and keep the project team on track.</p></li>
<li><p>Improves quality of life: Projects designed within the sustainable framework of a green rating system create more livable and resilient communities with reduced waste, more opportunities to conserve and protect natural ecosystems, and residents who enjoy improved air and water quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Offers recognition: A project that earns a green rating is more visible within the community due to opportunities for media coverage, press releases and public relations communications. Green ratings also lead to greater tenant acceptance, and enhance owner image, build political capital and improve potential for other project awards.</p></li>

<h2>Is Sustainability Thermodynamically Possible?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-sustainability-thermodynamically-possible" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before we conclude, let’s consider a provocative question: Is sustainability even thermodynamically possible?</p>
<p>At first glance, this might seem contradictory. After all, according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, any process in a closed system increases the total entropy—meaning disorder or energy loss is inevitable. So, in a purely thermodynamic sense, sustaining an ideal, completely waste-free, and energy-efficient system forever seems impossible.</p>
<p>But does that mean sustainability is a lost cause? Let’s discuss!</p>

<li><p>Even though some energy loss is inevitable, by relying on renewable energy sources (like solar, wind, and hydro), we can maintain a balance that mimics natural processes, like ecosystems that recycle nutrients.</p></li>
<li><p>Or we could apply science computing an Exergy Footprint ExF, defined (Sciubba, 2012) as the amount of primary exergy (in J) globally consumed over the life of a commodity, including material, energy, labor, capital and environmental remediation costs and calculated on a life-time basis.</p></li>

</div>
<p>A reference listed below has a philosophically important conclusion (Sciubba, 2021) “It is rather clear that the socio-economical interpretation must be supported by the thermodynamic one, in the sense that if a system “uses” the incoming exergy flow in a way that leads to a total net depletion rate of (fossil or renewable) exergy sources, no societal organizational form can survive in the long run unless new exergy inputs are provided at a sufficient rate. It is true that the specific form of the societal organization may affect the exergy depletion rate, but this does not imply that such a “minimum exergy consumption” society may be acceptable from an ethical point of view: this decision implies a <em>value choice</em> and is outside of the realm of Thermodynamics. Studies that do not separate these two issues are therefore bound to reach wrong and misleading conclusions.”</p>
