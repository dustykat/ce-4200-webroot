<h3>Engineering Ethics – Your Foundation for a Responsible Career<a class="headerlink" href="#engineering-ethics-your-foundation-for-a-responsible-career" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Congratulations on reaching the culmination of your engineering education! As you prepare to enter the professional world, one essential aspect that will guide your career, beyond technical knowledge, is ethics. Today, we’ll explore why ethical decision-making is central to engineering practice and how it influences both your career and the safety of society.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-engineering-ethics">
<h3>What Is Engineering Ethics?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-engineering-ethics" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Engineering ethics is about the standards that govern the conduct of engineers. It covers principles of honesty, fairness, integrity, and responsibility. As engineers, we are entrusted with the public’s safety, health, and welfare, and this trust comes with a profound ethical duty.</p>
<p>Ethics in engineering is more than a set of rules—it’s a mindset. Whether you’re designing bridges, developing software, or working in the energy sector, the decisions you make have real-world consequences.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-principles-of-engineering-ethics">
<h3>Key Principles of Engineering Ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#key-principles-of-engineering-ethics" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Let’s review some of the core ethical principles that are relevant for engineers, regardless of discipline:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Your primary responsibility is always to protect the public. This includes designing safe systems, ensuring quality, and considering the environmental impact of your projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Act with honesty and integrity. Ethical engineers avoid deception and misrepresentation. Always be transparent with data, project limitations, and potential risks.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide competent services. Never accept a task you are not qualified to handle. Seek guidance, collaborate, or refer the work to someone with the appropriate expertise.</p></li>

<h3>Real-World Scenario – Engineering Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#real-world-scenario-engineering-integrity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Now, imagine this situation: You’re working on a new design for a municipal water system. Your manager instructs you to use a cheaper material that could save the project budget. However, you know that this material won’t last as long and might compromise the system’s reliability.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>This situation is where your ethical training comes into play. Cutting corners may save money in the short term, but your duty is to protect the public. Speak up—explain the long-term risks of using subpar materials. Engineering ethics calls for you to prioritize safety over profit.</p>
<p>Painfull Examples:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster#:~:text=The%20cause%20of%20the%20disaster,ability%20to%20seal%20the%20joints.">STS Challenger Failure</a> The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on January 28, 1986, was a tragic event that resulted from a combination of technical failures and significant ethical lapses in decision-making. At the heart of the disaster was the failure of the O-ring seals in the solid rocket boosters, which were not designed to function properly under the unusually cold conditions on the morning of the launch. Engineers at Morton Thiokol, the company responsible for the boosters, had raised serious concerns about the O-ring’s performance in low temperatures, advising against the launch. However, these warnings were not adequately addressed.<br><br>The ethical lapse stemmed from a breakdown in communication and the prioritization of organizational and political pressures over safety concerns. Despite the engineers’ recommendations, NASA officials and Morton Thiokol management, under pressure to meet the launch schedule and avoid delays, chose to proceed. This decision ignored the engineers’ professional responsibility to prioritize the safety of the crew and the public over external pressures. The Challenger disaster highlights the importance of adhering to ethical principles in engineering, where the lives of others often depend on making responsible, safety-first decisions, even in the face of immense external pressures.<br><br>This tragedy underscored how organizational culture and external influences can cloud ethical judgment, leading to catastrophic consequences. It serves as a critical reminder of the ethical obligations engineers have to voice concerns clearly and ensure they are heard, while organizations must foster a culture where safety is always the paramount concern.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_accident">TEPCO Fukushima Failure</a> The TEPCO Fukushima nuclear accident in March 2011 was a catastrophic event caused by a combination of natural disasters and significant ethical lapses in risk management and safety culture. Following a massive earthquake and tsunami, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant experienced multiple reactor meltdowns, leading to widespread radiation release. While the tsunami itself was beyond human control, TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) had been warned for years about the vulnerability of the plant to such natural disasters. Yet, ethical lapses in prioritizing profits and regulatory leniency over safety precautions played a major role in the disaster.<br><br>One of the critical ethical failures was TEPCO’s decision not to upgrade the plant’s defenses, despite knowing that the facility’s seawall was insufficient to protect against the kind of tsunami that eventually struck. Additionally, reports indicated that the company had ignored or downplayed expert warnings and deliberately delayed necessary safety upgrades to save on costs and avoid operational disruptions. TEPCO’s risk assessments were not transparent, and management did not act with the urgency that such significant safety concerns warranted. These decisions reflect a failure to uphold ethical responsibilities to protect both workers and the broader public from potential harm. <br><br> The Fukushima disaster revealed deep-rooted ethical issues in Japan’s nuclear energy sector, including poor regulatory oversight and a lack of accountability. TEPCO’s failure to prioritize long-term safety over short-term financial considerations and its unwillingness to be transparent with both government regulators and the public contributed to one of the most severe nuclear disasters in history. This event highlights the critical importance of fostering a strong safety culture and ethical accountability, especially in industries where the consequences of failure are catastrophic.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-35W_Mississippi_River_bridge">Minnesota Bridge Failure</a> The I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse in Minneapolis on August 1, 2007, which killed 13 people and injured 145, was largely the result of ethical lapses related to maintenance, oversight, and the prioritization of cost-saving measures over public safety. The immediate cause of the collapse was traced to a design flaw: gusset plates that were too thin to support the weight of the structure. However, the bridge had been in service for over 40 years, during which time several warning signs about its structural deficiencies had emerged, including reports of cracking and corrosion. Despite these red flags, no significant corrective actions were taken.<br><br>:::{note}The I-35W bridge ranked near the bottom of federal inspection ratings nationwide. Bridge inspectors use a sufficiency rating that ranges from the highest score, 100, to the lowest score, zero. In 2005, they rated the bridge at 50, indicating that replacement may have been in order. Out of over 100,000 heavily used bridges, only about 4% scored below 50. On a separate measure, the I-35W bridge was rated “structurally deficient”, but was deemed to have met “minimum tolerable limits to be left in place as it is” <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi.cfm">NBI Source</a> ::: One of the most critical ethical failures was the insufficient attention given to these safety warnings. Both state officials and contractors responsible for inspecting and maintaining the bridge neglected to act with the urgency that the known structural issues demanded. There were missed opportunities to reinforce or replace the deficient gusset plates, which had been identified in various inspections. The prioritization of budget constraints and minimizing traffic disruptions over addressing structural vulnerabilities highlights a disregard for the ethical obligation to protect the public. Engineers and officials have a duty to ensure the safety of infrastructure, but in this case, cost-saving measures seemed to take precedence over preventive action.<br><br>Additionally, the collapse reveals lapses in communication between the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) and other stakeholders involved in bridge maintenance. A strong ethical commitment to transparency and proactive risk management could have prevented the disaster. The I-35W collapse demonstrates the critical importance of adhering to ethical standards in infrastructure management, where the consequences of ignoring or downplaying safety risks can lead to catastrophic loss of life and public trust.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_International_University_pedestrian_bridge_collapse">Florida Pedestrian Bridge Collapse</a> The Florida International University (FIU) pedestrian bridge collapse in March 2018 was a tragic incident caused by both engineering failures and significant ethical lapses in safety oversight and decision-making. The bridge, intended to provide safe passage for pedestrians across a busy highway, collapsed during construction, killing six people. Prior to the collapse, there were clear signs of structural issues, including large cracks in the bridge, which had been reported to both the construction team and project engineers. However, these warnings were not taken seriously enough, and no immediate action was taken to close the road or further investigate the structural integrity of the bridge.<br><br>A key ethical lapse was the failure of the project team to prioritize public safety. Despite knowing about the cracks, engineers from FIGG Bridge Engineers, the design firm, and other involved parties failed to halt construction or recommend traffic closures beneath the bridge. Instead, they downplayed the severity of the issue during a meeting just days before the collapse. The decision to proceed with work on the bridge, despite clear safety risks, reflects a breakdown in ethical responsibility. Engineers have a duty to safeguard the public, and the failure to act on the evidence of structural problems demonstrated a disregard for this obligation.<br><br>Additionally, there were communication failures between key stakeholders, including the contractor, engineer of record, and the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). These ethical lapses—failing to communicate effectively, ignoring critical safety warnings, and prioritizing project timelines over public safety—contributed to a preventable disaster. The FIU bridge collapse underscores the vital importance of ethical decision-making in engineering, particularly the responsibility to prioritize public welfare and safety above all else, even when facing pressure to meet project deadlines.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings">Boeing 737 Max Grounding</a> The Boeing 737 Max groundings, following two tragic crashes in 2018 and 2019 that claimed 346 lives, were the result of a series of ethical lapses related to safety, transparency, and corporate decision-making. The crashes were traced to a software system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which was designed to automatically correct the plane’s pitch. However, flaws in the system caused it to repeatedly push the aircraft’s nose down, overwhelming pilots who were unaware of the system’s full functionality. Boeing had failed to disclose critical details about MCAS to both airlines and pilots, prioritizing a streamlined transition for pilots from older models over comprehensive training on the new system. This decision reflected an ethical lapse in prioritizing cost-saving measures and market competition over safety and transparency.<br><br>Further ethical failures were evident in the relationship between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Reports revealed that Boeing exerted undue influence on the regulatory process, leading to minimal oversight and self-certification of critical systems like MCAS. The rush to compete with Airbus’ new fuel-efficient model led Boeing to prioritize meeting delivery schedules over thoroughly addressing safety concerns. This culture of expediency over safety led to critical issues being overlooked or downplayed, resulting in the catastrophic crashes. The Boeing 737 Max groundings highlight how ethical lapses in transparency, safety prioritization, and regulatory oversight can lead to disastrous consequences, emphasizing the importance of ethical responsibility in aviation and engineering.</p></li>
