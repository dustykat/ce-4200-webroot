    "This matters because disposal costs are usually based on the weight of the wet sludge (wet tons), not just the dry solids. If the sludge contains a lot of water, you end up paying to haul that water to the residuals handling or disposal site. By producing a drier “cake” with more solids, the volume and weight of water are minimized, which lowers the overall operating cost of hauling and disposal.\n",
