    "For simple equations, you can factor them by hand, but this equation does not factor easily. 3 can be factored into 1 and 3.

Instead simply use the quadratic formula (a.k.a. the quadratic equation) if the equation can't be factored easily or if you are unsure. A quadratic equation is of the form:\n",
