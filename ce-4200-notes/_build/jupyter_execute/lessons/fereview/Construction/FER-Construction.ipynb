    "<br> B. The activities with the greatest number of resources assigned.\n",
    "<br>**C.** The path of activities that determines the minimum project duration.\n",
    "<br> D. The activities most likely to cause safety incidents.\n",
    "\n",

    "<br>B. Determining time–cost tradeoffs during project acceleration.\n",
    "<br>**C.** Tracking planned vs. actual expenditures across the project timeline.\n",
    "<br>D. Ensuring that equipment is delivered to the site on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Which type of construction contract places the most financial risk on the contractor?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>A. Cost-plus-fixed-fee\n",
    "<br>**B.** Lump sum (fixed price)\n",
    "<br>C. Guaranteed maximum price\n",
    "<br>D. Unit price\n",

    "### 4. In the context of construction safety management, the “EMR” (Experience Modification Rate) is used by insurers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>A. Determine whether a contractor is allowed to bid on public work.\n",
    "<br>**B.** Calculate a contractor’s workers’ compensation insurance premium.\n",
    "<br>C. Measure equipment depreciation rates for tax purposes.\n",
    "<br>D. Quantify the number of days a worker may miss due to injury.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. A change order is typically issued when:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>A. The contractor wants to purchase new equipment for future projects.\n",
    "<br>**B.** The owner requests a modification to the work after contract award.\n",
    "<br>C. Weather delays require the project to be extended.\n",
