# # FE Review - Materials Science
# 
# :::{note}
# Materials science is related to mechanics of materials but not the same - the videos below are for Mechanics of Materials.  Usually a subject expert would give the review but no-one could be forced at the time of this writing.  So this is a YOYO topic.
