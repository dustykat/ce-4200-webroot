    "1. A wealth of study and professional opinion points to the importance of attitude in individual and group achievement.\n",
    "2. Teaching of attitudes is an integral part of educational practice.\n",
    "3. Attitudes are an integral part of the BOKs of other professions and specialties such as architecture, accounting, and law.\n",
    "4. Positive professional attitudes create a more effective and pleasant workplace.\n",
    "5. Perceptions of civil engineers may be enhanced by exhibiting positive attitudes, which may also lead to better career opportunities for civil engineers.\n",

    "Theory of Reasoned Action suggests that a person's behavior is\n",
    "determined by his/her intention to perform the behavior and\n",
    "that this intention is, in turn, a function of his/her attitude\n",

    "**Core Assumptions and Assertions**\n",
    "Theory of Planned Behavior/ Reasoned Action\n",
    "- The best predictor of behavior is intention. Intention is the cognitive representation of a person's readiness to perform a given behavior, and it is considered to be the immediate antecedent of behavior.\n",
    "- This intention is determined by three things: their attitude toward the specific behavior, their subjective norms and their perceived behavioral control.\n",
    ">- The theory of planned behavior holds that only specific attitudes toward the behavior in question can be expected to predict that behavior.\n",
    ">- In addition to measuring attitudes toward the behavior, we also need to measure people’s\n",
    "subjective norms – their beliefs about how people they care about will view the behavior\n",
    "in question. To predict someone’s intentions, knowing these beliefs can be as important as knowing the person’s attitudes.\n",
    ">- Finally, perceived behavioral control influences intentions. Perceived behavioral control refers to people's perceptions of their ability to perform a given behavior.\n",
    "- These predictors lead to intention. A general rule, the more favorable the attitude and the subjective norm, and the greater the perceived control the stronger should the person’s intention to perform the behavior in question.\n",
