# ## INTENTION OF “ATTITUDES”
# - At the professional level, one’s attitudes will affect how knowledge and skills are applied to the solution of a civil engineering problem. BOK2
# - “Professional attitudes are the positive and constructive attitudes that a civil engineer should display.” BOK3

# 
# ### Why Attitudes for Civil Engineers? BOK2
# 1. A wealth of study and professional opinion points to the importance of attitude in individual and group achievement.
# 2. Teaching of attitudes is an integral part of educational practice.
# 3. Attitudes are an integral part of the BOKs of other professions and specialties such as architecture, accounting, and law.
# 4. Positive professional attitudes create a more effective and pleasant workplace.
# 5. Perceptions of civil engineers may be enhanced by exhibiting positive attitudes, which may also lead to better career opportunities for civil engineers.

# ##  THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR/ REASONED ACTION
# 
# Theory of Reasoned Action suggests that a person's behavior is
# determined by his/her intention to perform the behavior and
# that this intention is, in turn, a function of his/her attitude
# toward the behavior and his/her subjective norm. (Ajzen, 1991)
#

# 
# **Core Assumptions and Assertions**
# Theory of Planned Behavior/ Reasoned Action
# - The best predictor of behavior is intention. Intention is the cognitive representation of a person's readiness to perform a given behavior, and it is considered to be the immediate antecedent of behavior.
# - This intention is determined by three things: their attitude toward the specific behavior, their subjective norms and their perceived behavioral control.
# >- The theory of planned behavior holds that only specific attitudes toward the behavior in question can be expected to predict that behavior.
# >- In addition to measuring attitudes toward the behavior, we also need to measure people’s
# subjective norms – their beliefs about how people they care about will view the behavior
# in question. To predict someone’s intentions, knowing these beliefs can be as important as knowing the person’s attitudes.
# >- Finally, perceived behavioral control influences intentions. Perceived behavioral control refers to people's perceptions of their ability to perform a given behavior.
# - These predictors lead to intention. A general rule, the more favorable the attitude and the subjective norm, and the greater the perceived control the stronger should the person’s intention to perform the behavior in question.

# ## Key Professional Attitudes... BOK3
# - Creativity... is the ability to make new things or form new ideas and is needed to solve complex civil engineering problems that do not have obvious solutions
# - Curiosity... is the urge to know about something and is essential for the civil engineer to gain new knowledge and to be more creative
# - Flexibility... is the ability to change or be changed according to the situation and is critical for civil engineers to work within a diverse group and in an ever changing environment
# - Dependability... is defined as the quality of being able to be counted on or relied upon and is an attitude civil engineers should display
