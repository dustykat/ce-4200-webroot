    "## Course Description: \n",
    "\n",
    "This required course is to addresses selected civil engineering body of knowledge topics  including preparation for the NCEES Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Exam, the importance of licensure, leadership and management, public policy, business aspects of engineering, and others. It integrates technical, professional, and social issues and contributes to the preparation of senior BSCE students to enter professional practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this course the student will\n",
    "- Explore and explain key concepts framing the civil engineering profession including body of knowledge topics such as leadership, business\n",
    "and public administration, and public policy\n",
    "- Explore and explain engineering aspects beyond the technical realm including safety, public health, sustainability, global and cultural aspects of project delivery\n",
    "- Explain the purpose, scope, and value of licensure.\n",
    "- Explore the current nature of the NCEES FE Exam as it relates to licensure\n",
    "- Apply resources and strategies to prepare for the FE Exam\n",
    "- Work FE Exam-like questions in selected topics using the FE Supplied Reference Handbook and subject matter expert supplied tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## ABET Program Outcomes \n",
    "This course specifically addresses the outcomes listed below.  Only the **primary outcome** is assessed as part of the CECE Continuous Improvement Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Outcomes\n",
    "- (2.)an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.\n",
    "- (4.) an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts\n",
    "- (7.) An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.\n",

    "## About ABET EAC Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcomes above (primary and secondary) are a subset of those prescribed in ABET EAC General Criteria for Bacculerate Programs as described in  [ABET (2024) Criteria for Accrediting ENGINEERING PROGRAMS. ABET, 415 North Charles St., Baltimore, MD 21201](https://www.abet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/23-24-EAC-Criteria_FINAL2.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Criteria 3, Student Outcomes**: The program must have documented student outcomes that support the program educational objectives. Attainment of these outcomes prepares graduates to enter the professional practice of engineering. Student outcomes are outcomes (1) through (7), plus any additional outcomes that may be articulated by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary outcomes (above) are assessed as part of the CECE Continuous Improvement Program that is prescribed in ABET EAC General Criteria for Bacculerate Programs as described in [ABET (2024) Criteria for Accrediting ENGINEERING PROGRAMS. ABET, 415 North Charles St., Baltimore, MD 21201](https://www.abet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/23-24-EAC-Criteria_FINAL2.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Criteria 4, Continuous Improvement**: The program must regularly use appropriate, documented processes for assessing and evaluating the extent to which the student outcomes are being attained. The results of these evaluations must be systematically utilized as input for the program’s continuous improvement actions. Other available information may also be used to assist in the continuous improvement of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment Methods and Data Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outcome 2 is assessed through a weighted composite of quiz and final examination scores corresponding to the instructional modules designated as “Beyond the Technical.” These instruments collectively assess students’ ability to recognize and integrate non-technical factors relevant to professional engineering practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outcome 4 is assessed using a weighted aggregate measure comprising class attendance, the Ethics quiz, and performance on ethics-related items in the final examination. This combination captures both engagement and demonstrated understanding of ethical principles in engineering contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outcome 7 is assessed by the normalized difference between quiz and final examination scores from the modules titled “Licensure and FE Exam Preparation.” A Wilcoxon signed-rank test is applied to determine whether the observed differences indicate a statistically significant improvement in student performance over the duration of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "These assessment data are collected and maintained on the department’s ABET server using the standardized course assessment forms, and the resulting summaries are utilized for both formal ABET accreditation documentation and the department’s annual continuous improvement program self-assessment process.\n",
