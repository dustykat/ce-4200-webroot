    "## Outcomes\n",
    "- Outcomes are statements that describe what individuals are expected to know and be able to do by the time of entry into the practice of civil engineering at the professional level in the 21st century—that is, **attain licensure**.\n",
    "- Outcomes define the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that individuals acquire through appropriate formal education and pre-licensure experience.\n",

    "> Cognitive Domain. The cognitive domain (Bloom, 1956) involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the development of intellectual abilities and skills.\n",

    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Affective Domain: includes “the manner in which we deal with things emotionally, such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms, motivations, and attitudes” (Krathwohl, Bloom, Masia, 1973.) Excitement, challenge, frustration, and even trauma are all emotions and experiences that require us to dip into our bank of coping skills and apply them in order to successfully navigate interpersonal situations.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Psychomotor Domain: includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.  \n",
