    "\n",
    "### What is \"breadth\"?\n",
    "\n",
    " A search for \"breadth\" in ASCE (2024) (from search for \"breadth\") produced 4 matches.  These matches are quoted below (a bit useless as excerpts, but illustrative of typical vagueness in your accrededation criteria)\n",

    "> \" ... program (not the PEV) must demonstrate that the specialty area or areas are appropriate to civil engineering\n",
    "in sufficient detail to make a well-reasoned judgment. This judgment must consider the balance of the\n",
    "desirability of curricular innovation against the need for relevant technical **breadth**.\"\n",
    "> \n",
    "> \" ... These **breadth** areas should be supported by constituent and stakeholder feedback and\n",
    "connected to the program's educational objectives. Possible justifications for nonstandard specialty areas\n",
    "might include the following:\n",
    ">- ASCE has an institute or technical division, publishes a journal, or sponsors specialty conferences in\n",
    "the technical area.\n",
    ">- A national or international civil engineering-related professional society has an institute or technical\n",
    "division, publishes a journal, or sponsors specialty conferences in the technical area.\n",
    ">- Civil engineering consulting or contracting firms specialize in the technical area.\n",
    ">- A technical area has a civil engineering connection with an applicable grand challenge from the\n",
    "National Academy of Engineering (NAE) or other initiatives by national or international engineering\n",
    "organizations.\n",
    ">- There is an applicable and established program in a technical area within a government agency to\n",
    "identify emerging areas of societal need. Examples could include programs with the Department of\n",
    "Commerce, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Department of Energy,\n",

    ">The list above is not inclusive, as many other legitimate, well-reasoned justifications are possible.\"\n",
    ">\n",
    "> \" ... In general, an advanced physics or chemistry course would not fulfill this requirement's intent because such a\n",
    "course would provide additional depth rather than additional **breadth** of scientific knowledge. Likewise,\n",
    "engineering science, materials science, and thermodynamics courses would not typically fulfill this\n",
    "requirement's intent.\"\n",
    ">\n",
    "> \" ... A technical core of knowledge and **breadth** of coverage in engineering mechanics and the ability to\n",
    "apply it to solve civil engineering problems are essential for civil engineers. \"\n",

    "A more general definition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Breadth of knowledge refers to the wide-ranging understanding across multiple disciplines, concepts, and perspectives, enabling individuals to recognize interconnections and apply diverse approaches to problem-solving. Rooted in frameworks like Bloom's Taxonomy, it emphasizes **foundational knowledge**, **comprehension**, and the **ability to analyze and synthesize** information from **varied fields** to address complex challenges."

    "## How ABET defines technical knowledge required for civil engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) defines the technical knowledge required for civil engineers through its Program Criteria and Student Outcomes, emphasizing both depth and breadth in engineering education. These criteria are specific to civil engineering programs and are detailed in collaboration with professional societies such as the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). \n",
    "\n",
    "### ABET's Student Outcomes for Civil Engineers\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "The outcomes listed below are literal paraphrasing of ABET-EAC outcomes!\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "ABET specifies seven broad outcomes that graduates must achieve, emphasizing skills, knowledge, and abilities. Hereâ€™s how they translate into the technical knowledge expected of civil engineers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Graduates must demonstrate the ability to:\n",
    "  - Identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems using principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.\n",
    "  - Example: Analyzing structural loads to design a safe and cost-effective bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Engineering Design**: Ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs, considering public health, safety, welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.\n",
    "  - Example: Designing a stormwater management system to mitigate flooding in urban areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Communication Skills**: Effective communication with diverse audiences, essential for presenting technical information to non-engineers and stakeholders.\n",
    "  - Example: Explaining hydrologic model outputs to a city planning commission.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ethical and Professional Responsibilities**: Understanding the societal, environmental, and global impacts of civil engineering solutions, along with ethical and professional responsibilities.\n",
    "  - Example: Adhering to sustainable practices while constructing a transportation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Teamwork**: Ability to work effectively in teams, providing leadership and fostering collaboration.\n",
    "  - Example: Collaborating with geotechnical and environmental engineers on a landfill design.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Experimentation and Analysis**: Ability to design and conduct experiments, analyze and interpret data, and apply engineering judgment.\n",
    "  - Example: Conducting soil testing to determine bearing capacity for foundation design.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Lifelong Learning**: Recognition of the need for and ability to engage in lifelong learning to stay current with evolving technologies and regulations.\n",
    "  - Example: Keeping up with advancements in hydraulic modeling tools like EPA SWMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Civil Engineering Program Criteria (ASCE and ABET)\n",
    "\n",
    "ABET specifies additional program-specific criteria for civil engineering, requiring graduates to demonstrate technical proficiency in areas such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mathematics, Science, and Engineering Principles**:\n",
    "  - Proficiency in calculus, differential equations, probability, and statistics.\n",
    "  - Application of these principles to solve engineering problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Technical Specializations**: Graduates must acquire **depth in at least one technical area** and **breadth across multiple areas of civil engineering**:\n",
    "  - Structural Engineering: Analysis and design of structures to resist loads.\n",
    "  - Transportation Engineering: Planning and design of systems for efficient movement of people and goods.\n",
    "  - Water Resources and Environmental Engineering: Hydraulic and hydrologic systems, treatment plants, and environmental sustainability.\n",
    "  - Geotechnical Engineering: Soil mechanics and foundation design.\n",
    "  - Construction Management: Project planning, scheduling, and cost estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "The implication is some level of mastery in one of the specializations, and familarity (competence) in several other areas.  This depth and breath requirement is why you are forced to take classes in topics that are not your favorite thing - as a practical matter no-one (even you) knows what you will work on and have to be able to do in a decade, but it is likely that it will have something to do with one or more of the specializations above.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standards and Codes**: Familiarity with industry standards and codes (e.g., AASHTO, ASCE Standards) relevant to civil engineering practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-World Applications**: Ability to integrate technical knowledge into practical, real-world projects that meet constraints like budgets, environmental impacts, and timelines.\n",

    "Its a bit overrated in terms of functional awesomeness. Excel has substantial limitations in model size and if the model contains VBA macros, it is essentially un-shareable.  Cloud based storage makes it even worse (to share a spreadsheet outside your enterprise network). Microsoft kind of shot itself in the foot with Office 365.  It is currently under beta testing as an interface to python (my gut is that Microsoft will drop VBA, once they have a viable python kernel that interfaces with Excel - that represents a second time in Excel history when MS changed the Macro Programming features, which deprecates anything pre-1994 as completely useless, and anything pre-2025 will begin to degrade.  Python itself shares this lack of backward compatability as Python 2.7 is a different language than Python 3.10+.
