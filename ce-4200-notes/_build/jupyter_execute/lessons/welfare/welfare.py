# # Evaluation of Welfare Considerations in Engineering Design
# 
# **This topic is an ABET required topic transferred from CE 4330 to this course**

# ## Introduction (5 minutes)
# 
# In this chapter, we explore how welfare considerations, grounded in the concept of Pareto optimality, play a critical role in engineering design.
#         
# :::{admonition} Welfare Definition 
# In civil engineering the functional definition is maximizing societal benefits without **disproportionately** disadvantaging others.
# Observe **equity** is not explicitly part of the definition - the definition admits (allows) the consideration of **sacrifice** zones, to achieve societal benefit.  So when we destroy land to extract oil, the lost land is the sacrifice for societal benefit.

# 
# - Relevance to Engineering:
#   - Welfare considerations influence public works, infrastructure, and large-scale projects.
#   - Engineers act as stewards of equitable resource allocation, balancing technical feasibility with societal impacts.
# 
# - Pareto Optimality:
#   - A state where no individual or group can be made better off without making someone else worse off.
#   - Emphasize: This concept does not equate to total equity but strives for efficient resource allocation.
#   
# :::{note}
# The Pareto concept is very much like utility ethics discussed elsewhere - and in fact utility could be used interchangeably herein.

# ## Core Concepts (10 minutes)
# 
# - Pareto Efficiency in Engineering:
#   - Decisions aim to optimize resources, performance, and societal benefits.
#   - Example: Designing public transportation to improve access without negatively impacting existing road users.
# 
# - Welfare Metrics in Engineering:
#   - Cost-benefit analysis: Evaluates economic trade-offs.
#   - Social utility functions: Quantifies collective benefits (e.g., environmental impact, accessibility).
# 
# - Key Challenges:
#   - Balancing competing interests (e.g., rural vs. urban needs in infrastructure).
#   - Accounting for non-monetary values (e.g., cultural heritage).

# ## Case Studies and Applications (15 minutes)
# 
# - Urban Infrastructure:
#   - Example: Designing a flood management system.
#   - Goal: Protect urban populations (Pareto gain) without adversely impacting upstream or downstream communities.
#   - Challenge: Addressing property rights and environmental considerations.
# 
# - Renewable Energy Projects:
#   - Example: Wind farm placement.
#   - Benefits: Clean energy, job creation.
#   - Challenges: Visual/aesthetic impacts, land use conflicts.
# 
# - Water Distribution Projects:
#   - Example: Equitably allocating water in a drought-prone region.
#   - Strategy: Use multi-objective optimization to balance agricultural, industrial, and residential needs.
# 
# - Ethical Dilemmas:
#   - What happens when Pareto efficiency isn’t achievable?
#   - Example: Highway construction through a low-income neighborhood. Discuss mitigation strategies, like community engagement and compensation.

# ## Interactive Component (5 minutes)
# 
# - Scenario-Based Discussion:
#   - Present a scenario: A city plans to build a new bridge. How can Pareto-optimal welfare be achieved?
#   - Encourage students to brainstorm: Stakeholders, trade-offs, and metrics for success.

# ## Key Lessons and Strategies (5 minutes)
# 
# - Systematic Evaluation:
#   - Use tools like decision matrices and optimization models.
#   - Example: Incorporate environmental, social, and economic factors in feasibility studies.
# 
# - Stakeholder Engagement:
#   - Involve all affected groups early in the design process.
#   - Example: Public consultations, surveys.
# 
# - Dynamic Thinking:
#   - Consider long-term impacts and adaptability.
#   - Example: Designing infrastructure to accommodate future population growth.

# ## Conclusion (5 minutes)
# 
# - Recap:
#   - Welfare in engineering is about balancing societal benefits and trade-offs.
#   - Pareto-optimal solutions provide a framework for efficient, equitable designs.
# 
# 
# - “As future licensed engineers, you’ll have the responsibility to ensure your designs improve welfare in meaningful ways. Strive for solutions that maximize societal benefit while minimizing harm.”
