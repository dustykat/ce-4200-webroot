# ## Why Public Health Matters in Engineering
# 
# - Definition of Public Health: Protecting and improving the health of populations through education, policy-making, and research.
# - Impact of Engineering: Infrastructure, products, and systems designed by engineers can significantly affect community health.
# - Examples: Clean water systems, transportation design, waste management.

# ## Key Public Health Considerations in Design 
# 
# Safety, accessibility, sustainability, and community engagement (stakeholder inputs) are key considerations in engineering design and construction.
# - Safety: Designing safe products and infrastructure (e.g., traffic systems that reduce accidents).
# - Accessibility: Ensuring that facilities are accessible to all, including those with disabilities.
# - Sustainability: Considering environmental impacts (e.g., pollution from industrial processes).
# - Community Engagement: Involving local communities in the design process to address specific health needs.
# 
# ### Safety: Designing safe products and infrastructure 
# - Overview: Safety is paramount in engineering design. Consider the implications of structural failures, product malfunctions, or hazardous materials.
# - Example: In transportation engineering, designing roads with adequate signage, barriers, and pedestrian crossings reduces accidents and fatalities.
# - Statistics: Use relevant statistics, such as the decrease in traffic-related injuries after implementing specific safety features to validate the emphasis on safety (often reduced injuried have direct economic benefit, and if it makes money - it will get built!)
# 
# ### Accessibility: Ensuring that facilities are accessible to all
# - Overview: Accessibility ensures that all community members, regardless of physical abilities, can use facilities and services.
# - Example: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) sets standards for accessibility in public spaces. Engineering designs must comply with these regulations.
# - Impact: Discuss how accessible design improves not just individual access, but also overall community health by promoting inclusion and mobility.
# 
# ### Sustainability: Considering environmental impacts
# - Overview: Sustainable engineering practices help mitigate environmental impacts that can harm public health.
# - Example: Designing energy-efficient buildings reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality.
# - Long-term Benefits: Emphasize how sustainable designs contribute to resilience against climate change, which can lead to public health crises.
# 
# ### Community Engagement: Involving local communities in the design process to address specific health needs.
# - Overview: Engaging with communities during the design process ensures that their needs and concerns are addressed.
# - Methods: Highlight tools like surveys, focus groups, and participatory design workshops.
# - Outcome: Projects that incorporate community input often see greater acceptance and usage, leading to better public health outcomes.

# ## Case Study 1: Water Treatment Systems
# 
# "Let’s look at an example : the design of water treatment systems."
# ### Background: 
# Historically, poor water quality led to widespread disease.  Before modern water treatment, cities faced cholera outbreaks and other waterborne diseases. The introduction of clean water significantly improved public health.
# ### Engineering Solution(s): 
# Implementation of filtration, biochemical treatment systems, and disinfection technologies are examples of engineering solutions, which combined with continuous (daily) monitoring greatly improve delivered water quality.
# ### Public Health Outcome(s): 
# Dramatic reductions in waterborne diseases. The cholera epidemic in London was curtailed after the installation of a comprehensive sewer system and clean water access.

# ## Case Study 2: Urban Transportation 
# 
# [Introduction to Case Study]
# "Now, let’s examine urban transportation systems."
# 
# ### Background: 
# Traffic congestion and accidents as public health issues.  Urban areas often struggle with traffic congestion, which contributes to air pollution and physical inactivity.
# ### Engineering Solutions: 
# - Bike Lanes: Encourage cycling, leading to healthier lifestyles.
# - Public Transit Improvements: Discuss investments in buses and subways that reduce car dependency and associated emissions.
# - Pedestrian Infrastructure: Creating walkable neighborhoods fosters community interaction and promotes physical activity.
#     
# ### Public Health Outcome: 
# Reduced air pollution and improved community health metrics. Reference studies showing reductions in asthma rates and obesity levels in cities that have prioritized active transportation.
# 
# [Engagement]
# "Have you noticed any changes in your local transportation systems that have aimed to improve public health?"

# ## Practical Steps for Students 
# 
# ### Learn and Research
# Stay informed about public health principles.
# 
# ### Collaborate
# Work with public health professionals in projects.
# ### Design Thinking
# Use design thinking to incorporate user feedback and public health needs into your designs.
# ### Advocate: 
# Promote health-focused engineering practices in your communities.
# 
# ## Conclusion 
# 
# "We’ve seen how engineering decisions affect public health and how you can integrate these considerations into your work."
# 
# :::{admonition} Include documented consideration of public health in your designs
# "As you progress in your engineering careers, always remember: the designs you create can lead to healthier communities. Let’s engineer a better future!"
