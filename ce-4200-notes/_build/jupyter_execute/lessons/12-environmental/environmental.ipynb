    "As engineers, your designs inevitably interact with the environment. Whether shaping the built environment, managing resources, or addressing waste, your decisions carry consequences for ecosystems, air and water quality, and future generations. Environmental considerations in engineering design are no longer optional — they are foundational to responsible, sustainable practice."

    "## Historical Context: Engineering and the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Public concern over environmental degradation accelerated in the mid-20th century, driven by disasters like the Cuyahoga River fire (1969), which symbolized the impact of unchecked industrial activity. This era gave rise to modern environmental legislation, including the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, and transformed how engineers approached project design.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the decades since, environmental stewardship has evolved from a regulatory burden into a core design principle. Today, successful engineers anticipate environmental impacts, incorporate mitigation strategies, and often aim to achieve positive ecological outcomes."

    "- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimize the use of energy, water, and raw materials. Examples include high-efficiency HVAC systems, water reuse strategies, and life-cycle material analysis.  \n",
    "- **Minimizing Pollution**: Designs must account for stormwater runoff, air emissions, noise, and solid waste. Best practices include sediment control systems and low-emission construction methods.  \n",
    "- **Ecosystem Preservation**: Infrastructure should avoid sensitive habitats. In some cases, habitat restoration or biodiversity offsets are incorporated into project plans.  \n",
    "- **Climate Resilience**: Increasingly, design must consider climate-related risks like flooding, drought, heat waves, and sea-level rise. Resilient design may include elevated structures, permeable pavement, or green infrastructure."

    "## Stakeholders and Environmental Justice\n",
    "\n",
    "Environmental impacts are rarely distributed evenly. Communities of color and low-income neighborhoods often face disproportionate exposure to pollution, flooding, and industrial development. Engineers must recognize these patterns and work to ensure that designs promote fairness, transparency, and meaningful public engagement — particularly during environmental impact assessments."

    "Environmental considerations are not solely the domain of regulators or scientists — they are integral to the engineering process. Ethical practice demands that you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proactively identify environmental risks  \n",
    "- Innovate toward more sustainable alternatives  \n",
    "- Communicate transparently with clients, regulators, and the public  \n",
